# Employee Summary

(https://github.com/Barakai/barakai.github.io/tree/master/homework10)
making a teams profile in one html using node.js
### How it works
 Run "node app.js" to start the application to make a html file with all team members.
It will start by asking you for the manager's information name, id, email, and office number.
after answer all questions it will ask you weather to add antoher member, you can choose Intern, Engineer, or I dont want to add more team members.

    For Intern it will ask you for name, id(number only and can not reuse the same id), email and school. 
    Then it will ask if you want to add another member again.
    
    For Engineer it will ask you for name, id(number only and can not reuse the same id), email and github username.
    Then it will ask if you want to add another member again.

Keep adding members untill all member is added, then choose "I dont want to add more team members" option when ask to add more members.
You will get a (my-team.html) file in the same folder when you are done with all team information inside.
For Engineer the github username is link to their profile.
